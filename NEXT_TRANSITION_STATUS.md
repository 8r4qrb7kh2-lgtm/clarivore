# Next.js Transition Status

## What is now Next-first
- Web app routes are provided by the Next app router (`/app/*`).
- Internal auth and navigation redirects now use Next routes on web.
- Vercel config is Next-first (`vercel.json`).
- Capacitor now uses Next export output (`webDir: "out"`).
- `cap:copy` and `cap:sync` now build Next before copying/syncing.

## Simplifications completed
- Shared route fallback UI extracted to `app/components/RouteSuspense.js`.
- Shared "last confirmed" formatting extracted to `app/lib/confirmationAge.js`.

- App-level `shared-nav` imports are now fully removed.
- `restaurant` runtime entry points are app-local modules (`app/**/runtime/legacy/*`) instead of `/public/js/*` URL imports.

- Removed all app-local admin legacy runtime files (`app/admin-dashboard/runtime/legacy/*`).

## Current migration inventory
- Legacy static HTML pages still present in `public/`: 15
- Legacy runtime JS files in `public/js/`: 108
- Next clients still booting legacy runtime modules via `/js/*`: 0 imports
- App-level `webpackIgnore` imports: 0
- App-local legacy runtime files:
  - `app/admin-dashboard/runtime/legacy`: 0
  - `app/manager-dashboard/runtime/legacy`: 0
  - `app/restaurant/runtime/legacy`: 67
- App routes still rendering raw topbar markup directly: 0

## Remaining high-priority work
1. Replace remaining app-local legacy runtime tree (`app/restaurant/runtime/legacy/*`) with native React/Next feature modules page-by-page.
2. De-duplicate remaining copied legacy utilities in `app/restaurant/runtime/legacy/*` against shared app modules.
3. Retire `public/*.html` and unused `public/js/*` runtime files after parity, leaving only static assets.

## Validation commands
- `npm run build`
- `npm run cap:copy`
